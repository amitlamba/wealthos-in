# Security (Public Repo)

This project is a **public repository**. Do not introduce or suggest anything that could expose sensitive data or create vulnerabilities.

## Never in Code or Commits

- **Secrets**: API keys, tokens, passwords, signing keys, webhook secrets
- **Credentials**: Database URLs, auth credentials, OAuth client secrets
- **Internal-only URLs**: Staging/admin URLs, internal APIs, non-public endpoints
- **PII**: Real emails, names, or identifiers (use placeholders in examples)
- **`.env`** or any file containing real env values — only `.env.example` with safe placeholders

## Environment Variables

- This project is a **marketing/static site** — it does **not** call a backend. Do not add API keys, auth tokens, or backend credentials.
- Use env vars only for public, non-secret config (e.g. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`). Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is needed; these are bundled and visible, so never put secrets here.
- Ensure `.gitignore` includes: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`.

## Safe Patterns

```typescript
// ✅ OK — public URL, safe default (only kind of env needed here)
const siteUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL ?? "https://wealthos.in";
```

```typescript
// ❌ BAD — no backend calls from this repo; do not add API keys or secrets
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
const apiKey = "sk_live_abc123...";
```

## When Adding Features

- Do not add backend API calls, API keys, webhook secrets, or auth credentials.
- No real internal URLs or IPs; use only public URLs (e.g. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) with safe defaults.
- In docs or README, use placeholders (e.g. `https://your-domain.com`), never real secrets.
